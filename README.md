# Guide-to-National-Parks
I've created a guide to U.S. National Parks. I included a few maps to show all of the parks. I added markers that respond to a modal that provides a picture, title, top features, and a link to each park's website. There is also a select box to show a list of the parks and access the same modal.

## Motivation
There isn't any great guides to the national parks. They involve a lot of clicking on multiple links that just provide text only. I wanted to create a site that makes people excited to visit the national parks without having to do too much research on each one.

## Tech/framework used
* Google Maps API to create map the maps
* Bootstrap as my styling framework
* JavaScript and jQuery
